The various components of this version of WRF-Chem are linked as Git
submodules, so they haven't actually been cloned yet.

To do so, in THIS directory, run the commands

git submodule init
git submodule update

Unfortunately you will need to enter the password for RCCohenLab for each
submodule (and there are 6). I recommend copying it to your clipboard, unless
you really enjoy typing that thing.
